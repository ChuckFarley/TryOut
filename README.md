Downloading rules - By not following these rules you will lose download privileges!

Access to the newest torrents is conditional on a good ratio!

Wait time works like this: From the time that each new torrent is uploaded to the tracker, there is a period of time that some users must wait before they can download it.

This delay in downloading will only affect users with a low ratio, and users with low upload amounts.
Ratio below 0.5 delay of 72h.
Ratio below 0.65 delay of 12h.

This applies to users that aren`t yet Power Users minimum. Opening an new account also won`t help, because you will be banned. This wait-time works at tracker level, you will be able to grab the .torrent file itself at any time.

Low ratios may result in severe consequences, including banning in extreme cases!

You must have legal rights to the file you are downloading.

Avatar Guidelines - Please try to follow these guidelines

The allowed formats are .gif, .jpg and .png.

Be considerate. Resize your images to a height of 220 px and a width of 110px and a size of no more than 150 KB. (Browsers will rescale them anyway: smaller images will be expanded and will not look good; larger images will just waste bandwidth and CPU cycles.) For now this is just a guideline but it will be automatically enforced in the near future.

Do not use potentially offensive material involving porn, religious material, animal / human cruelty or ideologically charged images.

Moderators have wide discretion on what is acceptable and what isn`t. If in doubt PM one of them.

Hit and Run - How Should I Seed

Sharing means not only downloading, but more importantly, seeding. To ensure that you don't get a warning for Low Ratio. To seed all you do is simply leave the torrent running in your client when it completes.

Below are some tips that will help you with your ratio:

Seed each torrent until their individual ratios are 1 or above.

Download and seed active torrents.

You will be given 5 bonus points per 45 mins for seeding a complete torrent (number of torrents seeded will NOT affect bonus points gained), which can be exchanged for GB upload credit.

Download torrents that are FREE LEECH which means only your upload stats will be recorded which will help your ratio in a big way as long as you seed. You will know if a torrent is free because it will have a green (F) next to the torrent name on the browse page.

There is also torrents that have a (X2) next to the torrent name on the browse page. This means that your download stats will be recorded however your upload stats will be doubled. So say you upload 100mb then you will receive 200mb added to your account. Providing it had the (X2) next to the name on the browse page.
